# Dental Analyzer
## Overview
**Dental Analyzer** is a tool to evaluate metrics of digital crown prep models. These metrics can be compared to their ideal values, in order to determine how well the crown model is prepared.

## What Dental Analyzer computes

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Shoulder width | Distance between margin line and axial line |
| Axial Wall Height | Distance between axial line and occlusal line |
| Taper | Half of total occlusal convergence, which is the angle formed between opposing axial walls |
| Margin Depth | Distance between axial walls of student prep and original prep, at 0.5mm above the margin line |
| Occlusal Reduction | Distance between occlusal of student prep and original prep |
| Gingival Extension | Distance between the margin line and gingiva line |
